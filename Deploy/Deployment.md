1. Select Subscription (if you have more than one)  

    If you do not have Azure Subscription, please create an account for free for 12 months

    <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>  

1. Create a new resource Group  

    A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Similar to folder and files.

    Open the dialog box by clicking `Create new` and give a unique name such as `MyOpenPlatformSolution`  

1. Select Region nearest to you

1. Select Unique ID  

    Some Azure services and names such as web site URL require globally unique ID.  The default is a random string based on the resource group.  You may enter your own unique ID string.

    - Minimum 5 characters
    - Maximum 12 characters
    - Alphanumeric characters only (no special characters)

1. If you are interested in adding Azure Digital Twins, set `Azure Digital Twins` = true  

1. Click `Review + create`, then click `Create` to start deployment  

    > [!TIP]  
    > Azure Portral validates your parameters, etc.
    > Some services may not be available in the region you selected.  Please select other regions.

### Review and Create Open Platform Solution

Typically the deployment process takes about 10 minutes.

## 3. Run Post Deployment Script

Some Azure services require additional settings, such as permission and access control. We will complete deployment by running a script in Cloud Shell.

1. Switch to `Outputs`  

    > [!TIP]  
    > You can always go to Deployment Outputs page in Azure Portal.  
    > Navigate to `Resource Group` and select `Deployment`

1. Copy `postDeploymentCommand` by clicking blue button next to the command line
